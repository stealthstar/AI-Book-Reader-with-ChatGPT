# myGPTReader

myGPTReader is a slack bot that reads web pages and summarizes them with chatGPT. You can use it to read news and summarize them in your slack channel.

For now it is in development, but you can try it out by join this [channel](https://join.slack.com/t/bmpidev/shared_invite/zt-1r38f90n5-bOp~RZqoMYiYMOtmKZsbcw).

> The exciting part is that the development of this project is also paired with chatGPT. I document the development process in this [CDDR](docs/chatGPT/CDDR.md) file.
